# Find the two's complement of integers

A small C program that calculates the two's complement of integers. You can pass input as arguments or use the interactive mode by not passing arguments.

I learnt how to compute two's complement from [this binary converter](https://github.com/mbadger88/BinaryToDecimalConverter) (a python program by [@mbadger88](https://github.com/mbadger88)).

#### To Do:
 - [X] Allow an argument as input
 - [X] Allow multiple args as input
 - [X] Add an interactive mode
 - [ ] Compute floating point values
