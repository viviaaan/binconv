# Find the two's complement of any integer

A small C program that converts integers to their two's complement representation when given as a command line arg.

I learnt how to compute the binary value from [this binary converter](https://github.com/mbadger88/BinaryToDecimalConverter) (a python program by [@mbadger88](https://github.com/mbadger88)).

#### To Do:
 - [X] Allow an argument as input
 - [X] Allow multiple args as input
 - [ ] Add an interactive mode
 - [ ] Compute decimal values
